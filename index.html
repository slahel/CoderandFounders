  <p>FunnilyÂ enough, my interest in learning coding actually started the dayÂ I met one of your alumni. She shared her experience, her story inspired my will in turning a new page. <br><br>
My work history has been filledÂ with many challenges and drawbacks that taught me adaptabilityÂ and perseverance.Â 
<br><br>Programming seems like an incredible opportunityÂ to embrace a new career in a fast-paced growing field.</p>

<div class="content">
  <p>Women are a minority in the coding world and studies show there are fewer women nowadays than in the 1980s. <br><br>I read many articles about how softwares reproduced biases of our societies and only a more diverse working place can promote a more representative industry. <br><br>I want to be a new voice and a different way of thinking that can improve the system.</p>

  <p>I am capable of working independently but I very much believe that team cooporationÂ help me be more efficent. 
    <br><br>I always worked in small companiesÂ and start-ups that offered me multitasking jobs,Â I often had to learn fast and on the ground. <br><br>To do so I relied on my colleagues not only to show me the way but also to help me ask the right questions and assess the situation appropriately.</p>

                  I obtained my diploma in Information and Communication at the University of Bordeaux, France. <br><br>At the peak of the financialÂ crisis, most companies slashed their marketing expenses. Having no network in Paris I carriedÂ on working in restaurants.

                  After a succession of small jobs, I decided to try my luck in the megalopolis. I started as a waitress in a cafe, then became the supervisor, then the team trainer. <br><br>I finally became their sales and marketing manager where I secured contracts with companies like Apple, Nike, or Estee Lauder.

                  The company ended up opening 2 news outlets in central London, then was bought by new investors and sadly my role became redundant. 
                  <br><br>I carried on a temp marketing role but then my accent became an issue. Unfortunately, many employers assumed that my English was not sufficient.

                  Circumstances forced me to have a big reflection about my career. Then I remembered this chat I had with one of your former students and she inspired me in getting a new direction.
                  <br><br> I started self-teaching through platforms such as Code Academy or SheCodes. I got introduced to SQL, Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Even if these experiences were very enriching, the lack of direct interactions was missed.
